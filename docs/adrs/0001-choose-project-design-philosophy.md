# Title
0001- Use of Domain Driven Design to build the Library Management System

# Status
Accepted

# Context
The Library Management System can be build using normal crud operations based architecture style or it can be built using Domain Driven Design by focusing most of the energy in identifying and developing a domain model.

# Decision
Since the exploration with the business experts has revealed that there are complex rules around borrowing and lending of books, managing members of the library, we will use Domain Driven Design to focus on domain first and implement the architrecture patterns that support this

# Consequences
1. We will have to focus more time on domain exploration and defining a ubiquitous language. There will be a cost and time overhead associated with this
2. We will need to create teams which include the developers and the subject matter experts.

# Compliance
We will use periodic reviews with the team to ensure that we are following best practices of the domain driven design
